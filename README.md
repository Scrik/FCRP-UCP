# Fort Carson Roleplay UCP
Fort Carson Roleplay was an international roleplaying server that focused on high-end and very hardcore, detailed roleplay. I developed this user control panel along with a couple partners of mine (Aviv, zCode and Fresh), and due to the fact that the server is no longer alive, I'm releasing this user control panel to the public. Feel free to take anything you would like, and contact me if you encounter any problems.
